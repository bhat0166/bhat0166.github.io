          Greetings! I am delighted to introduce myself as Deepanshu Bhatia, a
          recent graduate of
          <abbr title="DAV International School">DAV </abbr> 12<sup>th</sup>
          grade program. As someone who is always eager to expand my knowledge
          and skillset, I decided to take advantage of the vast array of online
          courses available to me. Specifically, I enrolled in courses on
          Blender 3D and Language Bootcamp, both of which have proven to be
          incredibly informative and beneficial for my career interests.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I am pursuing a degree in <strong> Media Design</strong> at
          Algonquin College, and I must say, it has been a truly enjoyable
          experience thus far. Through this program, I have been exposed to a
          wealth of information regarding <em>design</em>,<em>technology</em>,
          and <em>multimedia</em>, all of which have further reinforced my
          passion for this field. I am thrilled about the prospects that lie
          ahead for me as a result of this program and cannot wait to see where
          my future endeavors will take me.
        </p>
